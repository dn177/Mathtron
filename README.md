Math Note App build with React + Electron. Made for rendering and editing Latex. Rather programmed spontaneously since i didn't find an app that suits my needs.

# Instructions

Press Shift + Enter or the Enter button to push your input from the input area to local storage.
Click on an already pushed item and press any input (arrows count too) to toggle edit mode in which Latex will be displayed.
Press Shift + Enter or Escape in edit mode to save changes.

New Notebooks can be created and switched via the select menu in the top left corner.

# Latex

Wrap Latex input in $$.

Example:

```bash
110 $\times$ 10 $\ne$ 20
```

will render to:

$110 \times 10 \ne 20$
